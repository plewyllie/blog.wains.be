## A bit more about me

I like building simple, fast, powerful, resilient, secure and automated infrastructures. Preferably based on open tools and protocols.

I care about security and privacy.

I automate things whenever I can! I'm a big fan of [Ansible], [Node-RED], [Home Assistant], [Automagic] on Android or [Ulauncher] on Linux, and any device that comes with an open API.

I'm a heavy keyboard user and as such, [i3wm] is my window manager. I wrote about my desktop environment [here](https://blog.wains.be/2019/2019-12-11-my-linux-desktop-environment/).

When I'm not busy at the computer, I travel, hike, ski, camp out and take photos.

I'm an [INTJ]: INTJs are known as the "Systems Builders" of the types, perhaps in part because they possess the unusual trait of combining imagination and reliability. ~ [Marina Margaret Heiss](http://typelogic.com/intj.html)
