## Who am I?

My name is Sebastien Wains.

I'm a solution architect at Red Hat, the leading provider of enterprise open source solutions.

My background is mostly infrastructure but I'm interested in helping organizations in their DevSecOps journeys.

My current focus and areas of interest are [DevSecOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops), automation, infrastructure as code, security and Kubernetes.

I've been Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA) since March 29th, 2019.

[My certification ID is 110-643-822](https://www.redhat.com/rhtapps/services/verify/?certId=110-643-822).

Expiration dates are often in motion for RHCA. The badge might not be the latest :D

## A bit more about me

I like building simple, fast, powerful, resilient, secure and automated infrastructures. Preferably based on open tools and protocols.

I care about security and privacy.

I automate things whenever I can! I'm a big fan of [Ansible], [Node-RED], [Home Assistant], [Automagic] (now deprecated, which I replaced with MacroDroid) on Android or [Ulauncher] on Linux, and any device that comes with an open API.

I'm a heavy keyboard user and as such, [bspwm] is my window manager (after 6 years on [i3wm]). I wrote about my [i3wm](https://blog.wains.be/2019/2019-12-11-my-linux-desktop-environment/) and [bspwm](https://blog.wains.be/2021/2021-10-10-my-desktop-environment/) desktop environments.

When I'm not busy at the computer, I travel, hike, ski, camp out and take photos.

I'm an [INTJ]: INTJs are known as the "Systems Builders" of the types, perhaps in part because they possess the unusual trait of combining imagination and reliability. ~ [Marina Margaret Heiss](http://typelogic.com/intj.html)
