## Disclaimers

- This is a personal blog that is not related to my employer, my employer has no influence on my posts (which can talk about competing solutions)
- Opinions my own, yada yada.

## Who am I?

My name is Sebastien Wains.

I'm a solution architect / technical presales at Red Hat, the leading provider of enterprise open source solutions.

My background is mostly infrastructure but I'm interested in helping organizations in their DevSecOps journeys.

My current focus and areas of interest are [DevSecOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops), automation, infrastructure as code, security and containers.

I've been Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) since April 2007 and Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA) since March 2019.

[My certification ID is 110-643-822](https://www.redhat.com/rhtapps/services/verify/?certId=110-643-822).

Expiration dates are often in motion for RHCA. The badge might not be the latest :D



## A bit more about me

### Infrastructure Nerd

I like building simple, fast, powerful, resilient, secure and automated infrastructures. Preferably based on open tools and protocols. I care about security and privacy (without specifically being an expert).

### Automation Nerd

I automate things whenever I can! I'm a big fan of IT and home automation tools. I've used many: [Ansible], [Terraform], [SaltStack], [Node-RED], [Home Assistant], [Domoticz], [Automagic], [MacroDroid], etc.

### Linux Nerd

I'm a heavy keyboard user and as such, [bspwm] is my current window manager. I  wrote about my [bspwm](https://blog.wains.be/2021/2021-10-10-my-desktop-environment/) desktop environment. Before that I've used [i3wm] for about 6 years and wrote about it [here](https://blog.wains.be/2019/2019-12-11-my-linux-desktop-environment/). I use [Ulauncher] with workflows to automate things around the desktop and around the house.

### Besides computers

When I'm not busy at the computer, I travel, hike, ski, watch IT Crowd, camp out and take photos.

### Personality

I'm an [INTJ]: INTJs are known as the "Systems Builders" of the types, perhaps in part because they possess the unusual trait of combining imagination and reliability. ~ [Marina Margaret Heiss](http://typelogic.com/intj.html)

### Talks and conferences
