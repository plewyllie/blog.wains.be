title: Ansible Automates 2020 EMEA Talk

For readers interested in Ansible, I gave a talk about Ansible and Red Hat Consulting at the Ansible Automates 2020 Event, with my colleagues Anton and Marc.

Ansible Automates is a full day event, and it was virtual this year, as most events.

Our talk was mostly targeted at a business audience (which might not be the dominant audience of this blog :-)).

If you're looking for more technical content, Ansible Automates is packed with great technical sessions.
