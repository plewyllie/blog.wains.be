title: "DRAFT Home Assistant + Xiaomi Button + Conbee 2 + Zoneminder + LaMetric + Telegram = a smart 15 euro doorbell"
---

So you want a smart doorbell? I have wanted one for a long time.

My expectations:

- as open source as possible
- notifications on phone and other devices
- notified when not at home
- photo of the person
- fast, definitely under one second between the press of the button and the notifications

My problems:

- no electricity or possibility of cabling around the front door frame
- I don't want any device relying on some cloud (Ring and Amazon or such)
- A chime would certainly not be loud enough, I tend to wear headphones in my office most of the day

This is the end result, a notification in a Telegram group:

A notification on my LaMetric alarm:

### Want the same setup? Read on!

First, I'm definitely lying on the 15 euro click-baity statement.

If you don't already all that stuff (server running 24/7, cameras, LaMetric) your doorbell will end up costing hundreds of euros:

- server in the garage: around 600 euros
- outdoor camera: about 65 euros (Eminent EM6360)
- Conbee 2 Zigbee gateway: less than 40 euros (Amazon)
- LaMetric clock: typically 200 euros, got for 160 with coupon on their official store
- finally Xiaomi button: under 20 euros if you are impatient (Amazon), about 10 euros on Aliexpress
